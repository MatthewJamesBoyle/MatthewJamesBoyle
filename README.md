### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I'm Matt Boyle, I'm an Engineering Manager at Cloudflare. I care deeply about engineering productivity and developer tooling. 

I love Go, and wrote the best selling book [Domain-Driven Design with Golang](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Domain-Driven-Design-Golang-maintainable-business/dp/1804613452).

I also recently created a course called [The Ultimate Guide to Debugging with Go](http://bytesizego.com/the-ultimate-guide-to-debugging-with-go). I hope you find it interesting!
